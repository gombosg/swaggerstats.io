# Guide


Dashblocks aims to simplify enabling robust In-App Analytics: 

* Use declarative approach to define dashboard layout
* Provide reasonable out of the box defaults for all chart types, such as colors
* Support dark / light modes out of the box    
* Enable interactivity by providing event handling on dashboard level
* Streamline dynamic updates of dashboard data, for example based on user interaction with dashboard
* Even dynamically generate Dashboard itself based on the data - thanks to declarative approach   


## Installation

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install dashblocks --save


```
